# Crime_rate

Description: crimes.csv dataset reflects reported incidents of crime that occurred in US. 

My analysis addresses the following requests:

1. Find multicollinearity by applying VIF;
2. Standardize features;
3. Split data into train and test sets using seed=123;
4. Build linear regression model. p value of variables should be max 0.05;
5. Calculate RMSE and Adjusted R-squared;
6. Check overfitting.
